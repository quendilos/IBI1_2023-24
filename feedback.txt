In the previous practicals I upload the files one by one rather than pull it as a whole, I fix this problem in latter practicals
In practical 6 I FORGOT to mention my python version  and to add a reminder for importing pip, and thus may result in problems of running the same codes in different devices, which I fix it in practical 10.
In practical 4 I forgot to set the full text output, which miss the requirements in portoflio, I check it carefully in latter tasks.
